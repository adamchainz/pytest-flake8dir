2.6.1 (2021-08-11)
------------------

* Mark as unamintained. Following temporary directory fixture changes in
  pytest, I made a successor library,
  `pytest-flake8-path <https://pypi.org/project/pytest-flake8-path/>`__. I
  recommend you use that instead.

2.6.0 (2021-08-10)
------------------

* Add ``err`` and ``err_lines`` attributes for accessing the stderr of the
  flake8 process.

  Thanks to Matthew Gamble for the feature request in `Issue #221
  <https://github.com/adamchainz/django-linear-migrations/issues/221>`__.

* Add type hints.

2.5.0 (2021-05-10)
------------------

* Support Python 3.10.

2.4.0 (2021-05-10)
------------------

* Stop distributing tests to reduce package size. Tests are not intended to be
  run outside of the tox setup in the repository. Repackagers can use GitHub's
  tarballs per tag.

2.3.1 (2021-03-18)
------------------

* Use sys.executable to invoke flake8. This ensures that we run the flake8
  installed to match the current interpreter, in multi-interpreter
  environments.

2.3.0 (2020-12-13)
------------------

* Drop Python 3.5 support.
* Support Python 3.9.
* Move license from ISC to MIT License.

2.2.0 (2019-12-19)
------------------

* Update Python support to 3.5-3.8, as 3.4 has reached its end of life.
* Converted setuptools metadata to configuration file. This meant removing the
  ``__version__`` attribute from the package. If you want to inspect the
  installed version, use
  ``importlib.metadata.version("pytest-flake8dir")``
  (`docs <https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/importlib.metadata.html#distribution-versions>`__ /
  `backport <https://pypi.org/project/importlib-metadata/>`__).

2.1.0 (2019-04-13)
------------------

* Run ``flake8`` in a ``subprocess`` rather than trying to get a speed boost by
  running it in the current process. This is to overcome plugin state not
  resetting in-process in ``flake8`` 3.7.0+.

2.0.0 (2019-02-28)
------------------

* Drop Python 2 support, only Python 3.4+ is supported now.

1.3.0 (2018-10-16)
------------------

* A temporary ``setup.cfg`` file is now always created with no options and
  passed as ``--config``, to avoid flake8 merging in user-specific settings.
  Use ``make_setup_cfg`` to set the contents of this file.

1.2.0 (2018-02-25)
------------------

* The exit code from ``flake8`` is now saved on the ``Flake8Result`` object.
  Any tests that relied on catching ``SystemExit`` themselves will need
  refactoring to use the new attribute for their assertions.

1.1.0 (2017-06-23)
------------------

* Add convenience methods ``make_example_py`` and ``make_file``.

1.0.0 (2017-06-22)
------------------

* First version with basic fixture supporting ``make_py_files``,
  ``make_setup_cfg`` and ``run_flake8``.
